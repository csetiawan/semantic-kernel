# Quickstart with Poetry

## Installation

Install the Poetry package manager and create a project virtual environment.

```bash
# Install poetry package
pip3 install poetry
# Use poetry to install project deps
poetry install
# Use poetry to activate project venv
poetry shell
```

Make sure you have an
[Open AI API Key](https://openai.com/api/) or
[Azure Open AI service key](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart?pivots=rest-api)

Copy those keys into a `.env` file in this repo

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
OPENAI_ORG_ID=""
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=""
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=""
```

    allow a human being to come to harm.

    2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where
    such orders would conflict with the First Law.

    3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
